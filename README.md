# 🤏 Gesture Controlled Media Player

🎯 A hands-free, gesture-based media controller built using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. This project enables you to control media playback — such as play/pause and volume adjustments — using specific hand gestures detected by your webcam.

## 📸 Features

- ✅ Real-time gesture detection using hand signs 
- ✅ Media control via simple hand gestures:
  - ✊ **Right: Play/Pause (Thumb–Pinky)** – Play / Pause
  - ✌️ **Left Hand: Volume (Thumb–Index)** – Volume Up / Down
- ✅ Works with any system media player (via simulated keypresses)
- ✅ Uses your webcam for input, no special hardware needed
